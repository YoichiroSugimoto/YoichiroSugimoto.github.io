### Oxygen dependent control of mRNA translation

Translation efficiency is a key determinant of the expression level of genes. Cells globally repress mRNA translation in response to low oxygen availability (hypoxia), while maintaining the efficiency of genes which are required for the adaptation.  Molecular pathways which detect oxygen availability and control translation are not defined yet. One of the major challenge for this is a difficulty to accurately measure translational efficiency of mRNAs. To this end, I developed the high-resolution polysome profiling followed by sequencing of the 5â€² ends of mRNAs (HP5) technology; HP5 enables to (1) systematically measure global and gene-specific changes in mRNA translation and (2) resolve translational efficiency of mRNA isoforms by their transcription start sites (TSS) ([Sugimoto and Ratcliffe, bioRxiv, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.06.451052v1.full)). I applied the HP5 technology to investigate the  interplay of HIF and mTOR pathways, the most defined oxygen and nutrient sensing pathways. These two pathways are frequently dysregulated in kidney and other cancers. Although the well validated oxygen dependent regulator of transcription, the HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) protein, has been proposed to be responsible for oxygen-dependent translational regulation as well, the work demonstrated a limited effect of HIF on translation. In addition, this work revealed that translation of specific classes of HIF target genes have markedly different sensitivity to mTOR activity, indicating that the cellular response to oxygen availability is dependent on the availability of nutrients. I am currently investigating the genes responsible for oxygen-dependent translational regulation by applying the HP5 and other high-throughput technologies combined with cutting edge computational approaches.

### Oxygen dependent control of molecular condensation

Cells contain multiple compartments to facilitate biochemical processes; many of them are formed by membranes (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria) while recent studies showed that molecular condensates created through liquid-liquid phase separation can also contribute to the compartmentalization. Cells dynamically form molecular condensates under hypoxia. Yet, the target RNAs regulated by these condensates are largely unknown. The understanding was prevented by a difficulty in measuring RNA-RNA interactions, which play a crucial role in the formation of condensates. I developed the RNA hybrid and individual-nucleotide resolution ultraviolet crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (hiCLIP) technology that directly identify RNA-RNA interactions recognized by an RNA binding protein in a systematic manner ([Sugimoto et al., Nature, 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14280); [Sugimoto et al., Nature Protocol, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.188)). The application of hiCLIP to a component of stress responsive molecular condensates, STAU1, revealed the first global overview of RNA-RNA interactions in living cells, and characteristics of RNA structures which are recruited to the condensates. I am currently investigating RNA structures characterizing mRNAs recruited to the oxygen-dependent condensates. Furthermore, I am working to identify genes and mechanisms which regulate the formation of molecular condensates in response to oxygen availability.
